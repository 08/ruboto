Subject: [ANN] Ruboto 0.16.0 release candidate

Hi all!

The Ruboto 0.16.0 release candidate is now available.

In this release we add support for Android 4.4 KitKat!  You can also use
git-based gems in your Gemfile.apk, and implement framework methods like
onCreate in a Ruby Module and share them across Ruby classes.  We have
expanded the Android Fragment support to allow the use of the Ruboto
Widget DSL.  On the testing side, "ruboto setup" now downloads and
installs HAXM which gives a 10 times speedup of the emulator!  For early
adopters we now support Ruby 2.1 when using JRuby 9000 builds.

As always we need your help and feedback to ensure the quality of the release.  Please install the release candidate using

    [sudo] gem install ruboto --pre

and test your apps after updating with

    ruboto update app

If you have an app released for public consumption, please let us know.  Our developer program seeks to help developers getting started using Ruboto, and ensure good quality across Ruboto releases.  Currently we are supporting the apps listed here:
