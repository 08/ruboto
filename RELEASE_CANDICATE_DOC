Subject: [ANN] Ruboto 0.15.0 release candidate

Hi all!

The Ruboto 0.15.0 release candidate is now available.

In this release we stabilize the new SplashActivity feature and introduce
a new rapid development cycle.

Using "rake update_scripts:reload" changed Ruby scripts are pushed to the
device/emulator and an intent is broadcasted to reload the files inside
the running app, and the currently displayed activity is restarted.

The process should take just a few seconds and avoids the full
build->transfer->restart cycle.

As always we need your help and feedback to ensure the quality of the release.  Please install the release candidate using

    [sudo] gem install ruboto --pre

and test your apps after updating with

    ruboto update app

If you have an app released for public consumption, please let us know.  Our developer program seeks to help developers getting started using Ruboto, and ensure good quality across Ruboto releases.  Currently we are supporting the apps listed here:

    https://github.com/ruboto/ruboto/wiki/Promoted-apps

If you are just starting with Ruboto, but still want to contribute, please select and complete one of the tutorials and mark it with the version of Ruboto you used.
